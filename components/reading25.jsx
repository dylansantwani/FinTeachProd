      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Now that we've covered all the units in this financial literacy course, it's time to bring everything together into a comprehensive financial plan.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What is a comprehensive financial plan?</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        A comprehensive financial plan is a document that outlines your current financial situation, your financial goals, and the strategies you'll use to achieve those goals. It incorporates elements from all the units we've covered, including budgeting, saving, smart spending, and investing.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How do you create your comprehensive financial plan?</h2>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-lg mb-4">
        <li>Review Your Financial Goals: Look back at the goals you set in Unit 1. Have they changed or evolved as you've learned more?</li>
        <li>Update Your Budget: Incorporate what you learned about needs vs. wants and value-based spending into your budget from Unit 3.</li>
        <li>Refine Your Savings Plan: Based on what you learned in Unit 4, how will you approach saving for your various goals?</li>
        <li>Outline Your Spending Strategy: How will you implement the smart spending strategies from Unit 5 in your day-to-day life?</li>
        <li>Include Your Investment Plan: If you're ready to start investing, include the investment plan you created in Unit 6.</li>
        <li>Set Up a Review Schedule: Decide how often you'll review and update your financial plan. Financial planning is an ongoing process, and your plan should evolve as your life changes.</li>
      </ol>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Write out your comprehensive financial plan, explaining how each element contributes to your overall financial well-being. This plan will serve as a roadmap for your financial journey, helping you make informed decisions and work towards your goals.
