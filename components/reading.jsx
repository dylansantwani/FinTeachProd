        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">What Causes Airplane Turbulence?</h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Airplane turbulence is caused by the plane encountering pockets of air that are moving in different directions or at different speeds. This can happen for a few reasons:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-4">
          <li><strong>Thermal Currents:</strong> The sun heats the Earth's surface unevenly, creating areas of warm and cool air. As the plane flies through these thermal currents, it can experience bumps and shakes.</li>
          <li><strong>Wind Shear:</strong> When the wind changes speed or direction suddenly, it can create turbulence. This is common near thunderstorms or mountain ranges.</li>
          <li><strong>Wake Turbulence:</strong> The wake of a plane in front of you can disrupt the air and cause bumps, especially during takeoff and landing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Is Turbulence Dangerous?</h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          While turbulence can be uncomfortable and scary, it is actually quite rare for it to cause any serious issues. Modern planes are built to withstand much more turbulence than a passenger would ever experience. The pilots are also trained to navigate around the worst of it.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          The most common problem with turbulence is that it can cause unsecured items to shift or fall, or cause passengers and crew to be thrown around if they're not buckled in. This is why flight attendants are trained to quickly secure the cabin and ensure everyone is seated with their seatbelts on when turbulence is expected.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Dealing with Turbulence</h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          If you find yourself in a bumpy flight, the best thing to do is stay calm and follow the instructions of the flight crew. Keep your seatbelt fastened, avoid getting up, and try to relax. The turbulence will usually pass within a few minutes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Remember that turbulence, while unpleasant, is a normal part of air travel and poses little real danger. Modern planes are engineered to handle it with ease. So try to sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride!
