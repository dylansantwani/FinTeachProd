        As a teen, you're likely experiencing your first taste of financial independence. It's exciting to have your own money, but it's crucial to find a balance between saving for the future and enjoying the present.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Importance of Balance</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        While saving is important, it's okay to spend some money on things you enjoy. The key is to find a healthy balance that allows you to work towards your financial goals while still having fun.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Tips for Balancing Saving and Spending:</h2>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Follow the 50/30/20 Rule: Allocate 50% of your income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. As a teen with fewer expenses, you might be able to save more than 20%.</li>
        <li>Prioritize Your Spending: Before making a purchase, ask yourself if it aligns with your values and goals.</li>
        <li>Look for Free or Low-Cost Alternatives: Find ways to enjoy time with friends that don't cost much money.</li>
        <li>Practice Delayed Gratification: Wait before making non-essential purchases. You might find you don't want the item as much after a few days.</li>
        <li>Use the "Cost Per Use" Method: When considering a purchase, think about how often you'll use the item. A $50 item used 50 times is just $1 per use, which might be worth it.</li>
      </ol>
