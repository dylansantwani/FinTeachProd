        Receiving your first paycheck is an exciting milestone. It's a tangible reward for your hard work and a step towards financial independence. However, it's crucial to manage this new income wisely to make the most of your earnings.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Understanding Your Paycheck</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        When you receive your first paycheck, you might be surprised to see that the amount is less than you expected. This is because of deductions. Your paycheck will typically show your gross pay (the total amount you earned) and your net pay (the amount you actually receive after deductions).
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Common deductions include federal and state taxes, Social Security, and Medicare. If you're under 18, you might not have all these deductions, but it's important to be aware of them as you move into adulthood.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Take some time to review your paycheck carefully. Make sure you understand each item listed and that the hours worked and pay rate are correct. If anything seems off, don't hesitate to ask your employer for clarification.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Creating a Plan for Your Paycheck</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Now that you have a regular income, it's time to put it to work for you. A good rule of thumb is the 50/30/20 rule:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-4">
        <li><strong>50% for needs:</strong> This includes things you must pay for, like transportation costs to get to work or school supplies.</li>
        <li><strong>30% for wants:</strong> This is money for fun and discretionary spending, like going out with friends or buying new clothes.</li>
        <li><strong>20% for savings:</strong> This goes towards your financial goals, whether short-term like saving for a new phone, or long-term like saving for college.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Remember, these percentages are just guidelines. As a high school student with fewer expenses, you might be able to save a higher percentage.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Paying Yourself First</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        One of the most important habits you can develop is "paying yourself first." This means putting money into your savings before you start spending on wants. When you receive your paycheck, immediately transfer your planned savings amount into a separate savings account. This way, you're prioritizing your financial goals and reducing the temptation to overspend.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Tracking Your Income and Expenses</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Start keeping track of all the money you earn and spend. This can be as simple as writing it down in a notebook or using a budgeting app on your phone. Tracking your money helps you understand your spending habits and ensures you're sticking to your financial plan.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        By managing your first paycheck wisely, you're setting yourself up for financial success in the future. Remember, the habits you form now can last a lifetime, so make them good ones!
