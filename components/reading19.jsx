      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What is value-based spending?</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Value-based spending is about aligning your purchases with your personal values and what's most important to you. It's not about never spending money, but rather spending intentionally on things that truly matter to you.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How can you practice value-based spending?</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Start by identifying your values. What's most important to you? Education? Experiences? Helping others? Once you've identified your values, reflect on your past purchases. Did they align with these values? Did they bring lasting satisfaction?
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        One useful strategy is the 24-hour rule. For non-essential purchases, wait 24 hours before buying. This pause can help you avoid impulse spending and give you time to consider whether the purchase truly aligns with your values.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Another concept to consider is cost per use. A $50 item used 50 times is $1 per use, which might be better value than a $10 item used only once. This thinking can help you make more informed decisions about larger purchases.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why is value-based spending important?</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Value-based spending helps you make more satisfying purchase decisions, align your spending with your long-term goals, reduce regret over purchases, and make the most of your limited resources. Remember, what's valuable to you might be different from what's valuable to others. The goal is to spend your money in ways that bring you genuine satisfaction and align with your goals.
